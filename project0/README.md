Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

---------------------------------------------------------------

*This project is part of the online course [CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-web-programming-python-and-javascript).*

In this project, the goal was to create a webpage from scratch using the basics of HTML5 and CSS3, extending its power with Bootstrap4 and SASS. Since I'm a web developer already, I decided to give some life to this page and integrated a JavaScript lib to animate the background: [ParticlesJS](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/).

I decided to create my first personal webpage which was a project that I was keeping on hold for a long time.
The site itself is organized in 4 HTML files:

- *index.html*, which is the front door for the website and the welcome/home page
- *about.html*, which is a biographic page containing some information about myself
- *research.html*, which is a page dedicated to the research projects where I participated
- *get-in-touch.html*, which is an *in construction* contact page with some links to my social network


The project itself is organized according the following tree:
```
